              The Indian Insitute of Technology(Banaras Hindu University), Varanasi owes its existence to the farsighted

              institutions were established viz. the Benaras Enginnering College (BENCO) in 1919, the College of Minning and Metllurgy
               (MINMET) in 1923 and the College of Technology (TECHNO) in 1932, as the constituent units of Banaras Hindu University.
               In 1968 three engineering colleges merged to form the Institute of Technology (IT) BHU. In 2012 IT (BHU) had been 
               converted to IIT (BHU).
